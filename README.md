# Girls_In_Tech_Hackathon
Repository for the Girls In Tech - Hacking for Humanity (2019) Project

Official Project on Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/govet-xnw3fy

The theme was how to help veterans and their families.

## GoVet
GoVet is a mobile web application that aims at raising awareness about veteran considerations by gamifying and exposing them to veteransâ€™ stories so that they better appreciate the veteran population in their local community.

## Team
Team Name: QRS (QR code Scan)
Team Members: Chris Davis, Jon Tara, Kim Tien Vu, Kimiko Okumura, Nicole Lee, Pan Yeung, Rickesh Khilnani, Yuling Shi

## What it does?
First scan QR code, then collect veteran trading cards to gain points to redeem for rewards!

## How we built it?
We have used Figma to design the User Interface, and react, PHP, WordPress, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front-end of the website.

## Challenges we ran into?
Targeted audience, no funding, domain knowledge limited

## What did we learn?
#breakitdown: organize problems into tractable components and design solutions
#purpose: Identify and evaluate underlying goals and the values on which they are based
#rightProblem: characterize the nature of the problem
#evidenceBased: Identify and appropriately structure the information needed to support an argument effectively
#analogies: use analogy of the baseball trading cards
#constraints: time, money, learn skills given time constraint, domain knowledge limited
#communicationDesign, #multimedia

## What is next?
Further developing the selection algorithm, improving the design and layout of the website and the cards, incorporate more non-profit organizations and establishments that support veterans and give them benefits/discounts, attach a database to our project, encourage more businesses to partner with us so that there are more rewards for the general public, and encourage people to volunteer.
